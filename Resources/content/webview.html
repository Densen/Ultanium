<h1>Head of Dept. Introduction...</h1>
<p>As Head of the Social Policy Section of the Department I’d like to extend a ‘virtual’ welcome to the University of York via this message! I’m looking forward to meeting you in person when you arrive at the University in October, but I hope that the information we’ve gathered here on our Welcome site will help to make you feel at home in the Department before your course actually begins.</p>

<p>We’ve created this Welcome site to help ease you into studying at York. While some of you will be very familiar with the way the University of York works – having studied here or at a similar British university – I know that for some of you the University of York will not only be a new experience, so will the United Kingdom and the experience of studying in the English language. For those of you for whom like in a British university is a familiar experience, we hope that some of the information we provide here will prove useful in helping you orientate yourself before you start your degree. For those of you completely new to the UK, we hope that the information provided here will help answer some of the broad questions you are likely to have about what life in the UK and at the University of York will be like in practice.</p>

<p>Hopefully too, for all of you, the site will help make you feel at home in the Department before you arrive here. I look forward to personally welcoming you to the University when the academic year begins in October.</p>

<p><em>John Hudson, Head of Social Policy Section.</em></p>
